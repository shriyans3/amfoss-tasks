-> Krypto Scrapper task was a very unique one .Doing web scraping was not a difficult task as many documentations were present on how to do with python and other lang's but using rust a languge was the real task. Not much documentation was available on the internet for doing web scraping using rust.Referred the rust official documentation.
But by following the given article in the task I could complete it. Faced issues near csv part but after spending time was able to figure it out.

->go to main.rs file then run cargo build then use cargo run. Inside the foo.csv we have stored the top 50 Crypto's details.
