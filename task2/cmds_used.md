I have used the following steps below :-  
1. Used the git clone cmd to clone https://github.com/gauthamk02/TerminalHunt.git repo to my local repository.
2. created a new directory solution with mkdir cmd.
3. Used cd solution cmd and then touch part1.txt to create a file in solution folder. Edited the file with the found password. 
4. Hcf was 6 used cd to go into file_no 6 and then cat cmd to view the file.
5. cat part2.txt in solution folder and wrote the password using vi.
6. Check the commit log then use cd cmd to redirect to the file use mv x.txt part3.txt.Then use mv part3.txt ./solution/ to move to your solution dir.
7. git add . , git commit -m "My tasks" (adding all modified files till now with "My tasks" as message) can use git log to check the commits.
8. use git branch to check all branches,git checkout asia .
9. find . athens.txt is cmd I used.
10. git checkout main then git merge asia (for merging asia to main) , git checkout main, git merge asia, cp ./Greek-Empire/athens.txt ./solution/ then used mv to rename mv athens.txt part4.txt
11. cat part1.txt part2.txt part3.txt part4.txt > password.txt then rm part1.txt part2.txt part3.txt part4.txt to del all files except password.txt
12. Thats all I have used for completing the task.
